                <h2>Tanking is the most important role in The Elder Scrolls Online, as tanks are responsible for drawing the attention of enemy forces and protecting their allies. Tanking involves using a combination of heavy armor, crowd control abilities, and mitigation skills to absorb and deflect damage from enemy attacks.</h2>

                <h2>Players can choose to play as a tank by selecting a class that specializes in this role, such as the Dragonknight or the Necromancer. These classes have access to a variety of abilities that allow them to control the battlefield, including crowd control skills such as stuns and knockdowns, and mitigation abilities that reduce the damage they take.</h2>
                
                <h2>In addition to controlling the flow of combat, tanks are also responsible for positioning enemies in a way that maximizes the damage dealt by their allies. This involves using taunts and other abilities to draw the attention of enemies and keep them focused on the tank, while the rest of the group focuses on dealing damage.</h2>
                
                <h2>Tanking in The Elder Scrolls Online requires a combination of skill, strategy, and teamwork, as tanks must work closely with their allies to succeed in combat. Effective tanking can be the key to success in both PvE and PvP content, making it an important role for players who enjoy challenging gameplay and the satisfaction of protecting their allies.</h2>
                
                <h2>Overall, tanking in The Elder Scrolls Online is a complex and rewarding role that offers players a unique and challenging experience as they navigate the dangers of Tamriel.</h2>

                <h1><a href="esoHealers.html">Healer Information</a></h1>

                <h2>Healing is a crucial aspect of gameplay in The Elder Scrolls Online. In the game, players can choose to play as a healer character, or they can simply use healing spells and abilities to support their allies in combat.</h2>

                <h2>There are several different ways to heal in the game, including using restoration spells, potions, and abilities. Restoration spells can be cast on allies to heal their wounds and restore their health, while potions can be consumed to provide a quick burst of healing. Additionally, some classes have unique abilities that allow them to heal their allies, such as the Templar's "Rite of Passage" ability.</h2>
                
                <h2>Healing in The Elder Scrolls Online is not just limited to combat, as players can also use restoration spells and abilities to heal the land and restore balance to the world of Tamriel. This can be done through questing and completing certain objectives, such as cleansing contaminated water sources or removing corrupting influences from ancient ruins.</h2>

                <h1><a href="esoDPS.html">DPS Information</a></h1>

                <h2>DPS, or damage per second, is a critical aspect of gameplay in The Elder Scrolls Online. Players who specialize in DPS are responsible for dealing the majority of damage to enemies, and their performance has a direct impact on the success of their group in both PvE and PvP content.</h2>

                <h2>There are several different ways to build a DPS character in The Elder Scrolls Online, including using spells, weapons, and abilities. Players can choose from a variety of classes that specialize in different forms of damage, such as the Sorcerer, who deals magic damage, or the Nightblade, who specializes in stealth and critical strikes.</h2>

                <h2>Effective DPS requires a combination of skills and strategy, as players must choose the right abilities and weapons to maximize their damage output while also considering factors such as enemy resistances and the overall flow of combat. Additionally, players must be able to stay alive and avoid drawing the attention of enemies, as taking damage or being stun-locked can greatly reduce their damage output.</h2>

                <h2>In PvP combat, DPS players play a crucial role in taking down enemy players and securing victories for their team. In PvE content, they are responsible for quickly and efficiently defeating enemies and clearing dungeons and trials.</h2>

                <h2>Overall, DPSing in The Elder Scrolls Online is a complex and rewarding role that offers players a variety of play styles and opportunities to test their skills and strategy in the dangerous world of Tamriel.</h2>
